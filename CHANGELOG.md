# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/). The **first number** of the version is the year. The **second number** is incremented with each release, starting at 1 for each year. The **third number** is for emergencies when we need to start branches for older releases, or for very minor changes.
